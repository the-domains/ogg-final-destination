The

**Aliʻi nui of Maui**

was the supreme ruler of the island of

[Maui][0]

, one of the four main

[Hawaiian Islands][1]

. The title is the same as that of the

_Ali_

ʻ

_i nui_

of the other islands. The title or phrase

_Mōʻī_

is sometimes used for the title of the monarchs of Maui; however, it is not an ancient word in the

[Hawaiian language][2]

and has origins in the mid 19th century. The only monarchs to officially hold the title of

_Mōʻī_

are

[Kalākaua][3]

and his sister

[Liliuokalani][4]

.
